## Python Environment Setup
If you are a beginner, then I suggest you to install & use Anaconda Navigator.
1. Installing Anaconda : https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/.
2. Getting started with Anaconda : https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/. <br> Anaconda gives you wide variety of handy tools. I suggest to you use JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook for quick running of Python coding and use Spyder for developing full fledged projects. 

Or you can simply use Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) or Kaggle Notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks)
<br>Getting started with Jupyter Notebook : https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

If you are familiar with Visual Studio Code, you can install Python extension and run python projects in VS code. 
<br> Links for Getting started with Python in VS Code:
1. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial
2. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python

If you want use any other IDE for python development, try to search for "Setting up Environment in (of your choice IDE)" in youtube or google.

You can see official tutorial of Python 3 in here (But I recommend SoloLearn - Learn Python mentioned below): https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/interpreter.html .
It definitely takes time to get used to Python interpreter and interface but it's fun and easy.

I suggest you to install Learn Python app from SoloLearn https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sololearn.python 
or learn from  https://www.sololearn.com/Course/Python/
Daily spend 10-15 minutes in Learn Python app and I am telling you, that you will get acquainted with Python easily.

There are plent of IDE's for python. Few among them are mentioned below: 
1. <b> PyCharm </b> - The Python IDE for Professional Developers (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) 
2. <b> Python IDLE </b> - Official IDE for Python 
3. <b> Anaconda </b>- Solutions for Data Science Practitioners and Enterprise Machine Learning (https://www.anaconda.com/) It provides a wide-variety of data science tools like JupyterLab for quick and easy project developing and testing, Sypder for Production level development, Orange - Drag and Drop tool for Data Science Workflows.
4. <b> Google Colab </b>- Online Jupyter Environment (https://colab.research.google.com/)
5. <b> Kaggle Notebooks </b>- Online Jupyter Notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks)

Geeks for Geeks is definitely a game changer to learn new techniques in almost every language, so visit https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-language-introduction/ randomly and try to explore as much as you can.

### Learning by practice is the best suite to learn python in quicker and faster way.<br> So Practice and get better!!
We will practice as we learn.

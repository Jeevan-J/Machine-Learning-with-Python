## Data Handling
In this module, we will learn more about data handling process with Python packages Pandas and Numpy with the help of Matplotlib and Plotly visualizations

### 1. Basic Data Handling
In Basic data handling, we will learn about four major topics with examples:
1. Data Analysis - to see how the data is stored, what type of data is available
2. Data Cleaning - to eliminate unwanted data and enhance the important data
3. Data Augmentation - to create synthetic data records (or) to create new features manually with existing data
4. Data Visualization - to see basic patterns and other graphical visualizations which will help us in designing our model

### 2. Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding
